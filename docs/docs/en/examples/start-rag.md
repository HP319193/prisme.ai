### Introduction to Test-Driven Development in AI Knowledge

In the rapidly evolving field of AI, maintaining a consistent and reliable development process is crucial. Test-Driven Development (TDD) within the AI Knowledge platform enables a collaborative environment where Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Developers, and Business Teams can work together efficiently. This unified approach ensures that everyone operates from a single source of truth, significantly enhancing efficiency and agility across teams.

#### Benefits of a Unified Development Approach

- **Efficiency**: By aligning all stakeholders around a shared set of tests and outcomes, teams can avoid duplicative work and miscommunications, speeding up the development cycle.
- **Agility**: With a shared understanding of objectives and metrics, teams can more rapidly adapt to changes in project scope or market demands without losing momentum.
- **Value Delivery**: Continuous integration of feedback through TDD allows teams to iteratively improve the product, ensuring that enhancements and optimizations directly address user needs and real-world performance.
- **Incremental Improvement**: As tests are run and re-run, they not only validate the AIâ€™s performance but also guide further development, allowing for gradual enhancements that cumulatively lead to a superior product.

This approach not only streamlines project management and development but also underpins a culture of continuous improvement and cross-disciplinary collaboration, driving forward the development of robust and effective AI systems. By implementing TDD, organizations can foster a dynamic and responsive development environment, ultimately leading to faster delivery of high-value AI solutions.

## Creating an AI with RAG Specialization Using AI Knowledge

### Introduction

AI Knowledge allows for the effective management of a knowledge base by integrating various documents from sources like files, websites, and text into a unified system. This tutorial explains how to create an AI using the RAG architecture.

### Prerequisites

- Access to the AI Knowledge platform.
- Basic understanding of prompting.
- Documents or data to be integrated (web pages, PDFs, Word, PPT, JSON...).

### Step 1: Understand the AI Knowledge Interface

First, familiarize yourself with the AI Knowledge platform's architecture. It includes components like the Home > AI section, where you can manage your AI models, and tools for document integration, query handling, and customization.

- **Home**: Configure AI models , select embedding models, and set other parameters/

- **Test**: Configure Tests, supervize and analyze results

- **Analytics**: some KPI to monitor your AI usage: tokens, generated answers, daily usage... 

- **Docs**: Embeded documentation to 

### Step 2: Setting up Your Knowledge Base

Create a new project in AI Knowledge to organize your documents effectively.

1. **Log into AI Knowledge**: Access your dashboard.
2. **Create a New Project**: Navigate to the project management area and create a new project for storing your knowledge base.


### Step 3: Understand the AI Knowledge Architecture


### Step 4: Integrating Documents

To include web pages and PDFs into your knowledge base, follow these steps:

1. **Document Integration**: Use the system's interface to add documents from your selected sources.
2. **Segmentation and Vectorization**: Documents are loaded, segmented into chunks, and vectorized. This process involves settings adjustments such as:
   - **Text Splitter**: Choose between static or dynamic modes for document segmentation.
   - **Embeddings Settings**: Customize how text is transformed into vectors.

### Step 4: Querying the Knowledge Base

With your documents integrated, you can begin querying your knowledge base using the provided tools:

1. **Perform Queries**: Use the AI Knowledge interface to execute queries across your integrated documents.
2. **Customize Query Handling**: Adjust settings like Self-Query and Enhance User Query to improve retrieval accuracy.

### Step 5.1: Advanced customization using the Builder

For enhanced customization and to improve collaboration with business teams, such as developing specific RAG pipelines, utilize the Builder:

1. **Access the Builder**: Go to this feature on the Prisme.ai Platform.
2. **Implement Custom Code**: Use Python or NodeJS to incorporate specific functionalities with LLamaIndex or Langchain. Once you've set up the automation (making it accessible via URL), copy the URL and proceed to **Home > API & Webhook** on the platform. Here, enable the webhook and enter the automation URL. You can subscribe to notifications for actions like asked questions, and when documents are added, deleted, or updated, as well as for tests.

### Step 5.2: Advanced customization using your own hosted code 

You can link your AI Knowledge project to your externally hosted code using a Webhook. To achieve this, navigate to **Home > API & Webhook** on your platform to configure your URL and enhance your project with specific functionalities.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Maintenance

Regularly monitor your system to ensure optimal performance. Make adjustments to your knowledge base and AI settings as needed based on feedback and performance metrics.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively create and manage an AI with RAG capabilities using AI Knowledge. This setup allows for the efficient retrieval of information and customization of the AI to meet specific needs, enhancing your ability to manage and leverage data within your organization.

### Additional Resources

For further guidance, refer to AI Knowledge's detailed documentation sections:
- **API References**: Learn how to interact with your knowledge base programmatically.
- **Glossary**: Understand key terms and components used within the platform.
- **Tutorials and Community Support**: Engage with other users and find solutions to common challenges.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to create a specialized AI that leverages the power of RAG for enhanced information retrieval and knowledge management.
