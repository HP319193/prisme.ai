# Prisme.ai

# Overview

Because we want to share, with non-developers, the pride of creating scalable software.  
Prisme.ai allows you to collect the interactions of Apps: an app can be a customer channel (phone, mail, live chat,
social networks, sms...) or software (CRM, ERP, AD, DMP, Analytics. ..).  
The solution then allows you to enrich these interactions by connecting them to each other, to boost certain processes
thanks to automation and AI, to finally expose them in the form of a Page according to needs and profiles. All this in
accordance with the regulations regarding private data.   
All of these interactions are collected, enriched and distributed in real time with a low-code approach.
